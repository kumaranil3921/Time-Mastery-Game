# Time Mastery

## Game Description

**[Time Mastery](https://kumaranil3921.github.io/Time-Mastery-Game/)** is a game that challenges your timing and reflexes. The objective is to stop the timer as close to a target time as possible. The closer you stop the timer to the target time, the higher your score. It's a test of precision, timing, and quick reflexes!

## How to Play

1. **Game Start**: The game begins with a countdown timer.
2. **Target Time**: A target time (e.g., 10.00 seconds) is displayed.
3. **Timer Start**: The timer starts counting up from 0.00.
4. **Stop the Timer**: The player must stop the timer as close to the target time as possible by pressing a button.
5. **Scoring**: The score is calculated based on the difference between the target time and the actual time when the player stops the timer. The smaller the difference, the higher the score.

## Scoring System

- If the player stops the timer exactly at the target time, they get the maximum score (e.g., 100 points).
- For each millisecond off from the target time, points are deducted from the maximum score.
- A scoring formula could be: `Score = MaxScore - (Difference * PenaltyFactor)`, where `Difference` is the absolute difference between the target time and the actual stop time, and `PenaltyFactor` is a multiplier that adjusts the score deduction rate.
